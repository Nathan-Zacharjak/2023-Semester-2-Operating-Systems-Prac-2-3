First Day.


[Illustration]

    A good action is its own
        reward.

                   _Dickens._

    The will to do well ... is the next
          thing to having the power.

                   _Mr. Pecksniff._

    Forgiveness is a high quality,
          an exalted virtue.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

    In love of home the love of
                country has its rise.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    Tears never yet wound up a clock or worked
              a steam-engine.

                   _Sam Weller._




Second Day.


    Show me the man who says
        anything against women,
      as women, and I boldly declare,
          he is not a man.

                   _Pickwick._

    Natural affection and instinct are the
            most beautiful
        of the Almighty’s works.

                   _Charles Cheeryble._

      It must be somewhere written that the
              virtues of the mothers
    shall occasionally be visited on the children,
          as well as the sins of their fathers.

                   _Mr. Jarndyce._

    We can all do some good, if we will.

                   _Dickens._




Third Day.


    In the cause of friendship ...
                  brave all dangers.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

    Let us be among the few who do their duty.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

          Fortune will not bear chiding.
    We must not reproach her, or she shuns us.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    It is an undoubted fact that all remarkable
                  men have had
        remarkable mothers.

                   _Haunted Man._

    Every man has his enemies.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._




Fourth Day.


[Illustration]

        For Heaven’s sake
              let us
      examine sacredly
    whether there is any
      wrong entrusted
    to us to set right.

                   _Little Dorrit._

    Surprises, like misfortunes,
          rarely come alone.

                   _Dombey and Son._

    What the poor are to the poor is little known
        excepting to themselves and God.

                   _Bleak House._

    An honest man is one of the few great works
          that can be seen for nothing.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

    Thinking begets thinking.

                   _Oliver Twist._




Fifth Day.


    It’s a world of sacred mysteries,
              and the Creator only
          knows what lies beneath the surface
              of His lightest image.

                   _Battle of Life._

    There is hope for all who are softened
                and penitent.
        There is hope for all such.

                   _Haunted Man._

    What I want is frankness, confidence,
          less conventionality,
    and freer play of soul. We are so dreadfully
            artificial.

                   _Dombey and Son._




Sixth Day.


[Illustration]

      Only time shall show us
          whither each
    traveler is bound.

                   _Little Dorrit._

                Women, the tenderest and most
                        fragile of all
            God’s creatures, were the oftenest
    superior to sorrow, adversity and distress.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

      The consciousness that we possess the sympathy
                and affection of one being,
    when all others have deserted us, is a hold, a stay,
            a comfort, in the deepest affliction,
        which no wealth could purchase, or power bestow.

                   _Pickwick Papers._




Seventh Day.

[Illustration]


    Cheerfulness and content are great
            beautifiers, and
      are famous preservers of good looks.

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

          The sea has no appreciation of great men,
    but knocks them about like small fry.

                   _Bleak House._

              A joke is a very good thing ...
    but when that joke is made at the expense of
            feelings, I set my face against it.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

    There can be no confusion in following Him
          and seeking no other footsteps.

                   _Little Dorrit._




Eighth Day.


    There is no situation in life so bad
        that it can’t be mended.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

        If the good deeds of human creatures
    could be traced to their source, how beautifully
                would even death appear;
        for how much charity, mercy, and purified
              affection would be seen to have
        their own growth in dusty graves!

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    Use and necessity are good teachers--
              the best of any.

                   _Stagg._

    Philosophers are only men in armour after all.

                   _Pickwick Papers._




Ninth Day.


    You must expect to go out, some
          day, like the snuff of a
      candle; a man can die but once.

                   _Little Dorrit._

    Energy and determination have done
          wonders many a time.

                   _Bleak House._

    Ride on over all obstacles, and win
                the race.

                   _David Copperfield._

    In journeys, as in life, it is a great deal easier
              to go down hill than up.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

    Let there be union among us.

                   _Mr. Pecksniff._




Tenth Day.


    Among men who have sound and
            sterling qualities,
        there is nothing so contagious
          as pure openness of heart.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

    There is not an angel added to the Host
            of Heaven but does its
      blessed work on earth in those that
                loved it here.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

          There is a providence in everything;
    everything works for the best.

                   _Dombey and Son._

    A man never knows what he can do till
                  he tries.

                   _Pickwick Papers._




Eleventh Day.


    Worldly goods are divided unequally,
                    and man must not repine.

                   _Bleak House._

[Illustration]

    Do as you would be
          done by!
      Forget and forgive!

                   _Battle of Life._

    But for some trouble and
      sorrow we should
    never know half the good
        there is about us.

                   _Haunted Man._

    Gallantry in its true sense
          is supposed to
    enoble and dignify a man.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._




Twelfth Day.


    We should all try to discharge
              our duty.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

    Unless we learn to do our duty to those
                  in our employ, they
          will never learn to do their duty to us.

                   _David Copperfield._

    Simplicity and plainness are the soul
                of elegance.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    There are dark shadows on the earth, but its
          lights are stronger in contrast.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

    There is always something to be thankful for.

                   _Little Dorrit._




Thirteenth Day.


    We all have some bright day--many of us,
              let us hope, among a crowd of others,--
      to which we revert with particular delight.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

          Be forever grateful unto all friends. Especially
    unto them which brought you up by hand.

                   _Mr. Pumblechook._

    Dignity and even holiness too, sometimes,
          are more questions
      of coat and waist coat
            than some
        people imagine.

                   _Oliver Twist._

[Illustration]




Fourteenth Day.


    Vice takes up her abode in many
          temples, and who can
      say that a fair outside shall not
            enshrine her?

                   _Dr. Losberne._

    Without strong affection and humanity of
        heart and gratitude to that
      Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great
    attribute is Benevolence to all things
                 that breathe,
      happiness can never be attained.

                   _Dickens._

    Unchanging love and truth will carry
          us through all.

                    _Dickens._

    Don’t try the feelings of any.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._




Fifteenth Day.


    There is a great end to gain,
        and that I keep before me.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    If your destiny leads you into public life
            and public station, you
    must expect to be subjected to temptations
          which other people is free from.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

    There is no substitute for thorough-going
        ardent, and sincere earnestness.

                   _David Copperfield._

    If our inclinations are but good and open-hearted,
              let us gratify them
      boldly, though they bring upon us loss
              instead of profit.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._




Sixteenth Day.


    There is no royal road to learning, and what
              is life but learning.

                   _Our Mutual Friend._

    Anxious people often magnify an evil and
                                  make it worse.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

[Illustration]

    Try not to associate
        bodily defects with
    mental, my good friend,
              except for a solid reason.

                   _David Copperfield._

        What we have to do is to turn our faces in our
    new direction, and keep straight on.

                   _Our Mutual Friend._

    Be careful to develope your talents.

                   _A Tale of Two Cities._




Seventeenth Day.


    Nothing is past hope.

                   _Christmas Carol._

                There is scarcely a sin in the world
    that is in my eyes such a crying one
              as ingratitude.

                   _Tom Pinch._

          Truth and honesty, like precious stones,
                        are perhaps
    most easily imitated at a distance.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

    Life is made of ever so many partings
          welded together.

                   _Great Expectations._

    The best among us need deal lightly
                with faults.

                   _Dickens._




Eighteenth Day.


[Illustration]

    Monarchs imagine
    attractions in the
      lives of beggars.

                   _Dombey and Son._

        No man who was not a true gentleman
            at heart ever was, since the
    world began, a true gentleman in manner.

                   _Great Expectations._

        All happiness has an end--hence the chief
    pleasure of its next beginning.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    You should feel the Dignity of Labour.

                   _The Chimes._

[Illustration]

        Nature often enshrines
          gallant and noble
    hearts in weak bosoms.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._




Nineteenth Day.


    It is the duty of a man to be just
            before he is generous.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

    It is difficult to offer aid to an independent
            man.

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

    Go in and win--an admirable thing to recommend
        if you only know how to do it.

                   _Pickwick._

        Dishonesty will stare honesty out of
    countenance any day in the week, if there is
            anything to be got by it.

                   _Hunted Down._

    The world is prone to misconstruction.

                   _Dombey and Son._




Twentieth Day.


    There never were greed and
        cunning in the world yet, that
          did not do too much
        and overreach themselves.

                   _David Copperfield._

    Be diligent, work for a steady independence,
                  and be happy.

                   _Dombey and Son._

    It is not on earth that Heaven’s justice ends.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

        Women, after all, are the great props
    and comforts of our existence.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

    Self-praise is no recommendation.

                   _Bleak House._




Twenty-first Day.


[Illustration]

      Every failure teaches
        a man something,
    if he will learn.

                   _Little Dorrit._

        Mystery and disappointment
      are not
          absolutely
      indispensable to the
        growth of love,
    but they are often very
      powerful auxiliaries.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

        The envious man beholds
          his neighbor’s
    honours even in the sky.

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

    A man can’t at all times be quite master
                of himself.

                   _Christmas Stories._




Twenty-second Day.


    May every blessing that a true and
          earnest heart can call
        down from the source of
      all truth and sincerity cheer and
            prosper you.

                   _Oliver Twist._

    God bless home once more, and all
            belonging to it.

                   _Haunted Man._

    Perhaps it’s a good thing to have an unsound
            hobby ridden to death.

                   _David Copperfield._

    Be as rich as you honestly can. It’s your
              duty. Not for your
        sake, but for the sake of others.

                   _Little Dorrit._




Twenty-third Day.


[Illustration]

    Who that has a heart fails to
        recognize the
    silent presence of another?

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

    Father Time is not always a
          hard parent, and
    though he tarries for none of
          his children,
      he often lays his hand lightly on
                those who use him well.

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

    Second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes,
            come easily off and on.

                   _A Tale of Two Cities._

[Illustration]

    It’s much easier to talk
          than to bear.

                   _Madam Mantalini._




Twenty-fourth Day.


    Where’s the good of putting
            things off?
        Strike while the iron’s hot.

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

    Money ... some people find their gratification
            in storing it up,
          and others in parting with it.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

      Only the wisdom that holds the clue to
          all hearts and all mysteries
    can surely know to what extent a man can
            impose upon himself.

                   _Little Dorrit._

    Every man came into this world for something.

                   _Gabriel Varden._




Twenty-fifth Day.


[Illustration]

    Perfect coolness and self-possession
        ... are indispensable
    accomplishments of a great mind.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

        The hill has not lifted its face to Heaven yet,
                that perseverance will not
    gain the summit of at last.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

          If you can’t get to be uncommon
    through going straight, you’ll never get to do it
              through being crooked.

                   _Great Expectations._




Twenty-sixth Day.


    Cheerful of spirit and guiltless
          of affectation true practical
              Christianity ever is.

                   _The Uncommercial Traveller._

    Live at least, in peace, and trust in God
                    to help.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

        Reflect upon your present blessings--
    of which every man has many--not on your
              past misfortunes,
          of which all men have some.

                   _Sketches by Boz._

    All other swindlers upon earth are nothing
              to the self-swindlers.

                   _Great Expectations._




Twenty-seventh Day.


    There’s a moral in everything, if
              we would
        only avail ourselves of it.

                   _Dombey and Son._

      It is the highest part of the highest creed
                to forgive before
    memory sleeps, and ever to remember how the
            good overcame the evil.

                   _Haunted Man._

    There is nothing, no, nothing innocent or
        good that dies and is forgotten.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    It does not follow that the more talkative a
                  person becomes
              the more agreeable he is.

                   _Dickens._




[Illustration]

Twenty-eighth Day.


    Blustering assertion goes for proof half
                over the world.

                   _Little Dorrit._

    From rough outsides serene and gentle influences
              often proceed.

                   _Dickens._

    A generous nature is not prone to strong
                aversions, and is slow
        to admit them even dispassionately.

                   _Little Dorrit._




Twenty-ninth Day.


    Work: don’t make fine playing
          speeches about
              bread, but earn it.

                   _Ralph Nickleby._

    If I do my duty, I do what I ought, and
          do no more than all the rest.

                   _Dombey and Son._

        Do not strive and struggle to enrich
    yourselves or to get the better of each other.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

    People accustomed from infancy to lie on
                down feathers,
      have no idea how hard a paving-stone
            is without trying it.

                   _Hard Times._




[Illustration]

Thirtieth Day.


    Memory, however sad, is the
          best and purest
      link between this world and a better.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._
 
          It’s enough for a man to understand his
                    own business,
    and not to interfere with other people’s.

                   _Christmas Carol._

    It’s a world full of hearts, and a serious world
                with all its folly.

                   _Battle of Life._




Thirty-first Day.


    Our judgments are so liable to be
            influenced by many
        considerations, which almost
      without our knowing it, are unfair,
    that it is necessary to keep a guard upon them.

                   _Little Dorrit._

    There are chords in the human heart--
            strange varying strings--
        which are only struck by accident.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

      It is well for a man to respect his own vocation,
                      whatever it is;
    and to think himself bound to uphold it, and
        to claim for it the respect it deserves.

                   _Little Dorrit._

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are o ften created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org. 

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

First Day.


[Illustration]

    A good action is its own
        reward.

                   _Dickens._

    The will to do well ... is the next
          thing to having the power.

                   _Mr. Pecksniff._

    Forgiveness is a high quality,
          an exalted virtue.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

    In love of home the love of
                country has its rise.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    Tears never yet wound up a clock or worked
              a steam-engine.

                   _Sam Weller._




Second Day.


    Show me the man who says
        anything against women,
      as women, and I boldly declare,
          he is not a man.

                   _Pickwick._

    Natural affection and instinct are the
            most beautiful
        of the Almighty’s works.

                   _Charles Cheeryble._

      It must be somewhere written that the
              virtues of the mothers
    shall occasionally be visited on the children,
          as well as the sins of their fathers.

                   _Mr. Jarndyce._

    We can all do some good, if we will.

                   _Dickens._




Third Day.


    In the cause of friendship ...
                  brave all dangers.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

    Let us be among the few who do their duty.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

          Fortune will not bear chiding.
    We must not reproach her, or she shuns us.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    It is an undoubted fact that all remarkable
                  men have had
        remarkable mothers.

                   _Haunted Man._

    Every man has his enemies.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._




Fourth Day.


[Illustration]

        For Heaven’s sake
              let us
      examine sacredly
    whether there is any
      wrong entrusted
    to us to set right.

                   _Little Dorrit._

    Surprises, like misfortunes,
          rarely come alone.

                   _Dombey and Son._

    What the poor are to the poor is little known
        excepting to themselves and God.

                   _Bleak House._

    An honest man is one of the few great works
          that can be seen for nothing.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

    Thinking begets thinking.

                   _Oliver Twist._




Fifth Day.


    It’s a world of sacred mysteries,
              and the Creator only
          knows what lies beneath the surface
              of His lightest image.

                   _Battle of Life._

    There is hope for all who are softened
                and penitent.
        There is hope for all such.

                   _Haunted Man._

    What I want is frankness, confidence,
          less conventionality,
    and freer play of soul. We are so dreadfully
            artificial.

                   _Dombey and Son._




Sixth Day.


[Illustration]

      Only time shall show us
          whither each
    traveler is bound.

                   _Little Dorrit._

                Women, the tenderest and most
                        fragile of all
            God’s creatures, were the oftenest
    superior to sorrow, adversity and distress.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

      The consciousness that we possess the sympathy
                and affection of one being,
    when all others have deserted us, is a hold, a stay,
            a comfort, in the deepest affliction,
        which no wealth could purchase, or power bestow.

                   _Pickwick Papers._




Seventh Day.

[Illustration]


    Cheerfulness and content are great
            beautifiers, and
      are famous preservers of good looks.

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

          The sea has no appreciation of great men,
    but knocks them about like small fry.

                   _Bleak House._

              A joke is a very good thing ...
    but when that joke is made at the expense of
            feelings, I set my face against it.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

    There can be no confusion in following Him
          and seeking no other footsteps.

                   _Little Dorrit._




Eighth Day.


    There is no situation in life so bad
        that it can’t be mended.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

        If the good deeds of human creatures
    could be traced to their source, how beautifully
                would even death appear;
        for how much charity, mercy, and purified
              affection would be seen to have
        their own growth in dusty graves!

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    Use and necessity are good teachers--
              the best of any.

                   _Stagg._

    Philosophers are only men in armour after all.

                   _Pickwick Papers._




Ninth Day.


    You must expect to go out, some
          day, like the snuff of a
      candle; a man can die but once.

                   _Little Dorrit._

    Energy and determination have done
          wonders many a time.

                   _Bleak House._

    Ride on over all obstacles, and win
                the race.

                   _David Copperfield._

    In journeys, as in life, it is a great deal easier
              to go down hill than up.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

    Let there be union among us.

                   _Mr. Pecksniff._




Tenth Day.


    Among men who have sound and
            sterling qualities,
        there is nothing so contagious
          as pure openness of heart.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

    There is not an angel added to the Host
            of Heaven but does its
      blessed work on earth in those that
                loved it here.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

          There is a providence in everything;
    everything works for the best.

                   _Dombey and Son._

    A man never knows what he can do till
                  he tries.

                   _Pickwick Papers._




Eleventh Day.


    Worldly goods are divided unequally,
                    and man must not repine.

                   _Bleak House._

[Illustration]

    Do as you would be
          done by!
      Forget and forgive!

                   _Battle of Life._

    But for some trouble and
      sorrow we should
    never know half the good
        there is about us.

                   _Haunted Man._

    Gallantry in its true sense
          is supposed to
    enoble and dignify a man.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._




Twelfth Day.


    We should all try to discharge
              our duty.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

    Unless we learn to do our duty to those
                  in our employ, they
          will never learn to do their duty to us.

                   _David Copperfield._

    Simplicity and plainness are the soul
                of elegance.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    There are dark shadows on the earth, but its
          lights are stronger in contrast.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

    There is always something to be thankful for.

                   _Little Dorrit._




Thirteenth Day.


    We all have some bright day--many of us,
              let us hope, among a crowd of others,--
      to which we revert with particular delight.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

          Be forever grateful unto all friends. Especially
    unto them which brought you up by hand.

                   _Mr. Pumblechook._

    Dignity and even holiness too, sometimes,
          are more questions
      of coat and waist coat
            than some
        people imagine.

                   _Oliver Twist._

[Illustration]




Fourteenth Day.


    Vice takes up her abode in many
          temples, and who can
      say that a fair outside shall not
            enshrine her?

                   _Dr. Losberne._

    Without strong affection and humanity of
        heart and gratitude to that
      Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great
    attribute is Benevolence to all things
                 that breathe,
      happiness can never be attained.

                   _Dickens._

    Unchanging love and truth will carry
          us through all.

                    _Dickens._

    Don’t try the feelings of any.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._




Fifteenth Day.


    There is a great end to gain,
        and that I keep before me.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    If your destiny leads you into public life
            and public station, you
    must expect to be subjected to temptations
          which other people is free from.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

    There is no substitute for thorough-going
        ardent, and sincere earnestness.

                   _David Copperfield._

    If our inclinations are but good and open-hearted,
              let us gratify them
      boldly, though they bring upon us loss
              instead of profit.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._




Sixteenth Day.


    There is no royal road to learning, and what
              is life but learning.

                   _Our Mutual Friend._

    Anxious people often magnify an evil and
                                  make it worse.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

[Illustration]

    Try not to associate
        bodily defects with
    mental, my good friend,
              except for a solid reason.

                   _David Copperfield._

        What we have to do is to turn our faces in our
    new direction, and keep straight on.

                   _Our Mutual Friend._

    Be careful to develope your talents.

                   _A Tale of Two Cities._




Seventeenth Day.


    Nothing is past hope.

                   _Christmas Carol._

                There is scarcely a sin in the world
    that is in my eyes such a crying one
              as ingratitude.

                   _Tom Pinch._

          Truth and honesty, like precious stones,
                        are perhaps
    most easily imitated at a distance.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

    Life is made of ever so many partings
          welded together.

                   _Great Expectations._

    The best among us need deal lightly
                with faults.

                   _Dickens._




Eighteenth Day.


[Illustration]

    Monarchs imagine
    attractions in the
      lives of beggars.

                   _Dombey and Son._

        No man who was not a true gentleman
            at heart ever was, since the
    world began, a true gentleman in manner.

                   _Great Expectations._

        All happiness has an end--hence the chief
    pleasure of its next beginning.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    You should feel the Dignity of Labour.

                   _The Chimes._

[Illustration]

        Nature often enshrines
          gallant and noble
    hearts in weak bosoms.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._




Nineteenth Day.


    It is the duty of a man to be just
            before he is generous.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

    It is difficult to offer aid to an independent
            man.

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

    Go in and win--an admirable thing to recommend
        if you only know how to do it.

                   _Pickwick._

        Dishonesty will stare honesty out of
    countenance any day in the week, if there is
            anything to be got by it.

                   _Hunted Down._

    The world is prone to misconstruction.

                   _Dombey and Son._




Twentieth Day.


    There never were greed and
        cunning in the world yet, that
          did not do too much
        and overreach themselves.

                   _David Copperfield._

    Be diligent, work for a steady independence,
                  and be happy.

                   _Dombey and Son._

    It is not on earth that Heaven’s justice ends.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

        Women, after all, are the great props
    and comforts of our existence.

[Illustration]

      Every failure teaches
        a man something,
    if he will learn.

                   _Little Dorrit._

        Mystery and disappointment
      are not
          absolutely
      indispensable to the
        growth of love,
    but they are often very
      powerful auxiliaries.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

        The envious man beholds
          his neighbor’s
    honours even in the sky.

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

    A man can’t at all times be quite master
                of himself.

                   _Christmas Stories._




Twenty-second Day.


    May every blessing that a true and
          earnest heart can call
        down from the source of
      all truth and sincerity cheer and
            prosper you.

                   _Oliver Twist._

    God bless home once more, and all
            belonging to it.

                   _Haunted Man._

    Perhaps it’s a good thing to have an unsound
            hobby ridden to death.

                   _David Copperfield._

    Be as rich as you honestly can. It’s your
              duty. Not for your
        sake, but for the sake of others.

                   _Little Dorrit._




Twenty-third Day.


[Illustration]

    Who that has a heart fails to
        recognize the
    silent presence of another?

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

    Father Time is not always a
          hard parent, and
    though he tarries for none of
          his children,
      he often lays his hand lightly on
                those who use him well.

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

    Second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes,
            come easily off and on.

                   _A Tale of Two Cities._

[Illustration]

    It’s much easier to talk
          than to bear.

                   _Madam Mantalini._




Twenty-fourth Day.


    Where’s the good of putting
            things off?
        Strike while the iron’s hot.

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

    Money ... some people find their gratification
            in storing it up,
          and others in parting with it.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

      Only the wisdom that holds the clue to
          all hearts and all mysteries
    can surely know to what extent a man can
            impose upon himself.

                   _Little Dorrit._

    Every man came into this world for something.

                   _Gabriel Varden._




Twenty-fifth Day.


[Illustration]

    Perfect coolness and self-possession
        ... are indispensable
    accomplishments of a great mind.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

        The hill has not lifted its face to Heaven yet,
                that perseverance will not
    gain the summit of at last.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

          If you can’t get to be uncommon
    through going straight, you’ll never get to do it
              through being crooked.

                   _Great Expectations._




Twenty-sixth Day.


    Cheerful of spirit and guiltless
          of affectation true practical
              Christianity ever is.

                   _The Uncommercial Traveller._

    Live at least, in peace, and trust in God
                    to help.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

        Reflect upon your present blessings--
    of which every man has many--not on your
              past misfortunes,
          of which all men have some.

                   _Sketches by Boz._

    All other swindlers upon earth are nothing
              to the self-swindlers.

                   _Great Expectations._




Twenty-seventh Day.


    There’s a moral in everything, if
              we would
        only avail ourselves of it.

                   _Dombey and Son._

      It is the highest part of the highest creed
                to forgive before
    memory sleeps, and ever to remember how the
            good overcame the evil.

                   _Haunted Man._

    There is nothing, no, nothing innocent or
        good that dies and is forgotten.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    It does not follow that the more talkative a
                  person becomes
              the more agreeable he is.

                   _Dickens._




[Illustration]

Twenty-eighth Day.


    Blustering assertion goes for proof half
                over the world.

                   _Little Dorrit._

    From rough outsides serene and gentle influences
              often proceed.

                   _Dickens._

    A generous nature is not prone to strong
                aversions, and is slow
        to admit them even dispassionately.

                   _Little Dorrit._




Twenty-ninth Day.


    Work: don’t make fine playing
          speeches about
              bread, but earn it.

                   _Ralph Nickleby._

    If I do my duty, I do what I ought, and
          do no more than all the rest.

                   _Dombey and Son._

        Do not strive and struggle to enrich
    yourselves or to get the better of each other.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

    People accustomed from infancy to lie on
                down feathers,
      have no idea how hard a paving-stone
            is without trying it.

                   _Hard Times._




[Illustration]

Thirtieth Day.


    Memory, however sad, is the
          best and purest
      link between this world and a better.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._
 
          It’s enough for a man to understand his
                    own business,
    and not to interfere with other people’s.

                   _Christmas Carol._

    It’s a world full of hearts, and a serious world
                with all its folly.

                   _Battle of Life._




Thirty-first Day.


    Our judgments are so liable to be
            influenced by many
        considerations, which almost
      without our knowing it, are unfair,
    that it is necessary to keep a guard upon them.

                   _Little Dorrit._

    There are chords in the human heart--
            strange varying strings--
        which are only struck by accident.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

      It is well for a man to respect his own vocation,
                      whatever it is;
    and to think himself bound to uphold it, and
        to claim for it the respect it deserves.

                   _Little Dorrit._

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are o ften created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org. 

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

First Day.


[Illustration]

    A good action is its own
        reward.

                   _Dickens._

    The will to do well ... is the next
          thing to having the power.

                   _Mr. Pecksniff._

    Forgiveness is a high quality,
          an exalted virtue.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

    In love of home the love of
                country has its rise.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    Tears never yet wound up a clock or worked
              a steam-engine.

                   _Sam Weller._




Second Day.


    Show me the man who says
        anything against women,
      as women, and I boldly declare,
          he is not a man.

                   _Pickwick._

    Natural affection and instinct are the
            most beautiful
        of the Almighty’s works.

                   _Charles Cheeryble._

      It must be somewhere written that the
              virtues of the mothers
    shall occasionally be visited on the children,
          as well as the sins of their fathers.

                   _Mr. Jarndyce._

    We can all do some good, if we will.

                   _Dickens._




Third Day.


    In the cause of friendship ...
                  brave all dangers.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

    Let us be among the few who do their duty.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

          Fortune will not bear chiding.
    We must not reproach her, or she shuns us.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    It is an undoubted fact that all remarkable
                  men have had
        remarkable mothers.

                   _Haunted Man._

    Every man has his enemies.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._




Fourth Day.


[Illustration]

        For Heaven’s sake
              let us
      examine sacredly
    whether there is any
      wrong entrusted
    to us to set right.

                   _Little Dorrit._

    Surprises, like misfortunes,
          rarely come alone.

                   _Dombey and Son._

    What the poor are to the poor is little known
        excepting to themselves and God.

                   _Bleak House._

    An honest man is one of the few great works
          that can be seen for nothing.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

    Thinking begets thinking.

                   _Oliver Twist._




Fifth Day.


    It’s a world of sacred mysteries,
              and the Creator only
          knows what lies beneath the surface
              of His lightest image.

                   _Battle of Life._

    There is hope for all who are softened
                and penitent.
        There is hope for all such.

                   _Haunted Man._

    What I want is frankness, confidence,
          less conventionality,
    and freer play of soul. We are so dreadfully
            artificial.

                   _Dombey and Son._




Sixth Day.


[Illustration]

      Only time shall show us
          whither each
    traveler is bound.

                   _Little Dorrit._

                Women, the tenderest and most
                        fragile of all
            God’s creatures, were the oftenest
    superior to sorrow, adversity and distress.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

      The consciousness that we possess the sympathy
                and affection of one being,
    when all others have deserted us, is a hold, a stay,
            a comfort, in the deepest affliction,
        which no wealth could purchase, or power bestow.

                   _Pickwick Papers._




Seventh Day.

[Illustration]


    Cheerfulness and content are great
            beautifiers, and
      are famous preservers of good looks.

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

          The sea has no appreciation of great men,
    but knocks them about like small fry.

                   _Bleak House._

              A joke is a very good thing ...
    but when that joke is made at the expense of
            feelings, I set my face against it.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

    There can be no confusion in following Him
          and seeking no other footsteps.

                   _Little Dorrit._




Eighth Day.


    There is no situation in life so bad
        that it can’t be mended.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

        If the good deeds of human creatures
    could be traced to their source, how beautifully
                would even death appear;
        for how much charity, mercy, and purified
              affection would be seen to have
        their own growth in dusty graves!

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    Use and necessity are good teachers--
              the best of any.

                   _Stagg._

    Philosophers are only men in armour after all.

                   _Pickwick Papers._




Ninth Day.


    You must expect to go out, some
          day, like the snuff of a
      candle; a man can die but once.

                   _Little Dorrit._

    Energy and determination have done
          wonders many a time.

                   _Bleak House._

    Ride on over all obstacles, and win
                the race.

                   _David Copperfield._

    In journeys, as in life, it is a great deal easier
              to go down hill than up.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

    Let there be union among us.

                   _Mr. Pecksniff._




Tenth Day.


    Among men who have sound and
            sterling qualities,
        there is nothing so contagious
          as pure openness of heart.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

    There is not an angel added to the Host
            of Heaven but does its
      blessed work on earth in those that
                loved it here.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

          There is a providence in everything;
    everything works for the best.

                   _Dombey and Son._

    A man never knows what he can do till
                  he tries.

                   _Pickwick Papers._




Eleventh Day.


    Worldly goods are divided unequally,
                    and man must not repine.

                   _Bleak House._

[Illustration]

    Do as you would be
          done by!
      Forget and forgive!

                   _Battle of Life._

    But for some trouble and
      sorrow we should
    never know half the good
        there is about us.

                   _Haunted Man._

    Gallantry in its true sense
          is supposed to
    enoble and dignify a man.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._




Twelfth Day.


    We should all try to discharge
              our duty.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

    Unless we learn to do our duty to those
                  in our employ, they
          will never learn to do their duty to us.

                   _David Copperfield._

    Simplicity and plainness are the soul
                of elegance.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    There are dark shadows on the earth, but its
          lights are stronger in contrast.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

    There is always something to be thankful for.

                   _Little Dorrit._




Thirteenth Day.


    We all have some bright day--many of us,
              let us hope, among a crowd of others,--
      to which we revert with particular delight.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

          Be forever grateful unto all friends. Especially
    unto them which brought you up by hand.

                   _Mr. Pumblechook._

    Dignity and even holiness too, sometimes,
          are more questions
      of coat and waist coat
            than some
        people imagine.

                   _Oliver Twist._

[Illustration]




Fourteenth Day.


    Vice takes up her abode in many
          temples, and who can
      say that a fair outside shall not
            enshrine her?

                   _Dr. Losberne._

    Without strong affection and humanity of
        heart and gratitude to that
      Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great
    attribute is Benevolence to all things
                 that breathe,
      happiness can never be attained.

                   _Dickens._

    Unchanging love and truth will carry
          us through all.

                    _Dickens._

    Don’t try the feelings of any.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._




Fifteenth Day.


    There is a great end to gain,
        and that I keep before me.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    If your destiny leads you into public life
            and public station, you
    must expect to be subjected to temptations
          which other people is free from.

                   _Pickwick Papers._

    There is no substitute for thorough-going
        ardent, and sincere earnestness.

                   _David Copperfield._

    If our inclinations are but good and open-hearted,
              let us gratify them
      boldly, though they bring upon us loss
              instead of profit.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._




Sixteenth Day.


    There is no royal road to learning, and what
              is life but learning.

                   _Our Mutual Friend._

    Anxious people often magnify an evil and
                                  make it worse.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    that is in my eyes such a crying one
              as ingratitude.

                   _Tom Pinch._

          Truth and honesty, like precious stones,
                        are perhaps
    most easily imitated at a distance.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

        Dishonesty will stare honesty out of
    countenance any day in the week, if there is

        and overreach themselves.

                   _David Copperfield._

    Be diligent, work for a steady independence,
                  and be happy.

                   _Little Dorrit._

        Mystery and disappointment
      are not
          absolutely
      indispensable to the

[Illustration]

    Who that has a heart fails to
        recognize the
    silent presence of another?

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

    Father Time is not always a
          hard parent, and
    though he tarries for none of
          his children,
      he often lays his hand lightly on
                those who use him well.

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

    Second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes,
            come easily off and on.

            things off?
        Strike while the iron’s hot.

                   _Barnaby Rudge._

    Money ... some people find their gratification
            in storing it up,
          and others in parting with it.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

      Only the wisdom that holds the clue to
          all hearts and all mysteries
    can surely know to what extent a man can
            impose upon himself.

          If you can’t get to be uncommon

    Cheerful of spirit and guiltless
          of affectation true practical
              Christianity ever is.

    Live at least, in peace, and trust in God
                    to help.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._

        Reflect upon your present blessings--
    of which every man has many--not on your
              past misfortunes,
          of which all men have some.

                   _Sketches by Boz._

    All other swindlers upon earth are nothing
              to the self-swindlers.

                   _Great Expectations._




Twenty-seventh Day.


    There’s a moral in everything, if
              we would
        only avail ourselves of it.

                   _Dombey and Son._

      It is the highest part of the highest creed
                to forgive before
    memory sleeps, and ever to remember how the
            good overcame the evil.

                   _Haunted Man._

    There is nothing, no, nothing innocent or
        good that dies and is forgotten.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

    It does not follow that the more talkative a
                  person becomes
              the more agreeable he is.

                   _Dickens._




[Illustration]

Twenty-eighth Day.


    Blustering assertion goes for proof half
                over the world.

                   _Little Dorrit._

    From rough outsides serene and gentle influences
              often proceed.

                   _Dickens._

    A generous nature is not prone to strong
                aversions, and is slow
        to admit them even dispassionately.

                   _Little Dorrit._




Twenty-ninth Day.


    Work: don’t make fine playing
          speeches about
              bread, but earn it.

                   _Ralph Nickleby._

    If I do my duty, I do what I ought, and
          do no more than all the rest.

                   _Dombey and Son._

        Do not strive and struggle to enrich
    yourselves or to get the better of each other.

                   _Martin Chuzzlewit._

    People accustomed from infancy to lie on
                down feathers,
      have no idea how hard a paving-stone
            is without trying it.

                   _Hard Times._




[Illustration]

Thirtieth Day.


    Memory, however sad, is the
          best and purest
      link between this world and a better.

                   _Nicholas Nickleby._
 
          It’s enough for a man to understand his
                    own business,
    and not to interfere with other people’s.

                   _Christmas Carol._

    It’s a world full of hearts, and a serious world
                with all its folly.

                   _Battle of Life._




Thirty-first Day.


    Our judgments are so liable to be
            influenced by many
        considerations, which almost
      without our knowing it, are unfair,
    that it is necessary to keep a guard upon them.

                   _Little Dorrit._

    There are chords in the human heart--
            strange varying strings--
        which are only struck by accident.

                   _Old Curiosity Shop._

      It is well for a man to respect his own vocation,
                      whatever it is;
    and to think himself bound to uphold it, and
        to claim for it the respect it deserves.

                   _Little Dorrit._

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are o ften created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org. 

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
