Transcriber’s Note:

Often, contracted words lack an apostrophe, two words are printed as
one, and elipses and hyphens are used inconsistently. Words may have
multiple spelling variations; all variations were retained as printed.
Dialect, obsolete words, alternative spellings and misspelled words
were not corrected.

Words and phrases in italics are surrounded by underscores, _like
this_. Obvious printing errors, such as backwards, upside down, or
partially printed letters and punctuation, were corrected. Unprinted
final stops and quotation marks were added.
